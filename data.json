The very first day is filled to the brim with amazing outdoor activities to start everyone off right.  Then our activity instructors individually welcome every child to the group and connections start to form.  Girls learn each other\u2019s names and find things in common.  Smiles spread.  Heads nod.  Shoulders relax. Then before you know it, something funny happens, fits of giggles erupt, and that quintessential Birchwood magic starts to happen. In all those impromptu seconds of joyful silliness - and in all of those zany \u201cyou had to be there\u201d kind of moments - Birchwood girls are active, soulful participants in their own lives. They are immersed in a kind of memory-making that simply can\u2019t happen back at home or in school.  Nah, this is special.  It\u2019s hard to define.  It is felt deep in the heart.  It feels like coming home. And that kind of good stuff, day after day, teaches us that one summer of fun is just the beginning.  From here on out, they are part of each other\u2019s story. Yep, once you\u2019re part of the Birchwood \u201cweb\u201d of friendship, you\u2019re tied to people who care about the REAL you, throughout your life.", "Testimonials": [{"quote": "\u201cIt is so nice to learn how to do something that you thought you could never do.
